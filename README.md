The solution consists of 4 projects (.NET 7.0 SDK): Data, Core, Web and API.

In Data is the layer of data access and database design.

In Core is all the business logic

Web is a project with a simple user interface, in which the data from the database is displayed

API is a project in which business logic processes can be used through the use of APIs

You can use this file to populate the database
